				DESTINATION IMAGINATION---Transforming Education One Challange At A Time
			</h1>

			<h2> We inspire young people to imagine and innovate today so they become the creative and collaborative leaders of tomorrow.
			</h2>
				<p>
				As parents and educators, our most important goal is to prepare our kids for the future. In Destination Imagination (DI), students work together in teams to solve open-ended STEAM challenges designed to teach the creative process. Why is that important?

				The creative process is a step-by-step approach that helps students better understand problems and ask better questions, come up with solutions, learn from failure, and celebrate their achievements.

				In going through this process, kids learn vital life and career skills—creative thinking, critical thinking, public speaking, and collaborative problem-solving—that help them feel empowered and set them up for success in their future.
				</p>
